# Coding Challenges

This repository indexes my Coding Challenges resolutions. 

I expect that these challenges help me to understand how to some coding tools were built, and some concepts that I forgot or that I do not have touch. I pretend to add each resolution to this repository using git submodules.

> Each challenge is presented with an introduction explaining the challenge. Where applicable there is a background section providing a brief introduction to any background knowledge you need to complete the challenge.

I invite you to complete these challenges too! If you want more details, access the Coding Challenges [website](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro).
